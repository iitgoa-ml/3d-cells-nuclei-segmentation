# 3D Cells and Nuclei Segmentation 

This repository is a supplement to the paper 
**On the variability in cell and nucleus shapes** by *Anusha Devulapally, Varun Parekh, Clint Pazhayidam George, and Sreenath Balakrishnan*. This project deals with the segmentation of cells and nuclei confocal images. Folders [cells](cells/README.md) and [nuclei](nuclei/README.md) show more details. 



## Data

The folder [data](data/) contains multiple cells and nuclei types where each folder representing each cell/nuclei type. 
Each folder has stacks of different cells of the same cell type. For more details, see the [documentation](data/README.md).
