# Cell segmentation 

We used two approaches to solve cell segmentation. One is CA-UNet and Watershed-based snake algorithm.

CA-UNet uses a deep learning based approach to solve the cell segmentation problem. More details on how to execute, see the [documentation] (https://github.com/iitgoa-ml/3d-cells-nuclei-segmentation/blob/master/cells/CA-UNet/README.md)

Watershed-based snake algorithm uses the image processing techniques to deal with cell segmentation. More details on how to execute, see the [documentation](https://github.com/iitgoa-ml/3d-cells-nuclei-segmentation/blob/master/cells/watershed_active_snakes/README.md)
