# Cell segmentation 

We use two approaches to solve cell segmentation: one is the CA-UNet algorithm, and the other is the Watershed-based snake algorithm.

- The CA-UNet algorithm uses a deep learning-based approach to solve the cell segmentation problem. For more details on how to execute, see the [documentation](https://github.com/iitgoa-ml/3d-cells-nuclei-segmentation/blob/master/cells/CA-UNet/README.md).

- Watershed-based snake algorithm uses image processing techniques to deal with cell segmentation. For more details on how to execute, see the [documentation](https://github.com/iitgoa-ml/3d-cells-nuclei-segmentation/blob/master/cells/watershed_active_snakes/README.md).
